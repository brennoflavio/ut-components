# Ubuntu Touch Components

Welcome to my personal library of components for Ubuntu Touch. The idea behind this project is to create
a reusable system for backend and frontent that will allow rapid creation of Ubuntu Touch Apps.

# Demo and Apps

This set of components powers the following applications in OpenStore:
- [Picpocket](https://open-store.io/app/picpocket.brennoflavio): An Immich Client
- [ContactBridge](https://open-store.io/app/contactbridge.brennoflavio): Sync your Nextcloud (or any CardDAV server) Address Books

# Installation

Simply copy the `src/qml` and `src/pyhton` folders to your project. For convenience, a install script is supplied that you can run in your git
repository

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brennoflavio/ut-components/refs/heads/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

# Python Components

To use this library, you need to setup on each python file before any imports.

from src.lib import setup

setup(app_name="yourapp.name", crash_report_url=None)

from src.lib.kv import KV

...
```
- [setup](docs/python/setup.md): Configure global variables for this package
- [config](docs/python/config.md): Provide starndard paths (cache, data, config) for your application.
- [crash](docs/python/crash.md): Implement backend for crash reports, and a decorator to send crashes to a server.
- [http](docs/python/http.md): Pure python HTTP client with a requests-like structure, on top of urllib.
- [kv](docs/python/kv.md): Key-Value storage on top of sqlite3 with ttl and batching support.
- [memoize](docs/python/memoize.md): Memoization support for python function on top of KV.
